**Individual Contributions** (Clearly highlight the contributions of each team member in both the GitHub repository and the video)
1. Both Bryant and Yuen In were involved in selecting datasets, with a total of 2 datasets examined by Bryant and 1 dataset examined by Yuen In before the final dataset was selected for use. 
2. Bryant and Jing Yun added text cells with explanations, such that the notebook had a smooth logical flow.
3. Bryant was responsible for handling missing values in the dataset.
4. Yuen In was responsible for encoding categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding, and scaling numerical features using Min-Max Scaling.
5. Bryant was responsible for splitting the data into test and training data sets.
6. Yuen In wrote the bulk of the code for Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and k-fold cross validation, with adaptation of the code to the datasets done by Bryant.
7. Jing Yun was responsible for comparing the models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score, and analysing cases where Linear Regression overfits and where Ridge Regression helps
prevent overfitting.
8. Jing Yun was responsible for interpreting the effect of different alpha values on the MSE and R^2 scores of the Ridge Regression Model, as well as discussing practical applications where each model would be more suitable.
9. Bryant was responsible for the overall project management, including the GitHub repository.
10. Jing Yun and Bryant put together the slides.
